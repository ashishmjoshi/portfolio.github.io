# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This workspace contains a small set of files, primarily HTML and Python scripts, with no evident subdirectories or complex architecture. There is no build system, test framework, or external dependencies detected. The project appears to be a collection of standalone scripts and HTML files, likely for experimentation or small-scale tasks.

## Key Files
- `yes.py`: Python script. Review this file for any reusable logic or patterns.
- `play.html`, `prg5.html`, `smt.html`, `t3.html`: Standalone HTML files. Each may represent a separate experiment or demo.

## Development Patterns
- There are no project-wide conventions, frameworks, or shared modules. Treat each file as independent unless you discover explicit cross-file dependencies.
- No evidence of a build or test workflow. Run Python scripts directly (e.g., `python yes.py`). Open HTML files in a browser for testing.
- No external package requirements or configuration files (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `package.json`).

## Guidance for AI Agents
- When adding new scripts, follow the flat structure: place new files at the root unless a clear need for subdirectories emerges.
- If introducing dependencies or workflows, document them clearly in a new `README.md`.
- If you discover implicit relationships between files, document them here for future agents.
- Keep instructions concise and update this file if the project structure evolves.

## Example: Running a Script
- To run the Python script: `python yes.py`
- To view an HTML file: open it in a web browser (e.g., double-click or use `start play.html` on Windows)

If you add new workflows, dependencies, or conventions, update this file to keep future agents productive.
